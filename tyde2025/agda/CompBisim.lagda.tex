To avoid the difficulty of working with guarded definitions, we use Nils Anders
Danielsson's method~\cite{danielsson-beating} of defining an embedded language
in this section to keep the definitions guarded. The only difference is that we
define coinductive types using coinductive records instead of the deprecated
``musical notation''~\cite{agda-coinduction}.
