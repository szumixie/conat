Natural numbers are the initial object in the category of algebras over the
$\mathbb{1} + {-}$ endofunctor.

In the Agda proof assistant, it can be represented as an inductive datatype:

\begin{code}
data ℕ : Type where
  zero  : ℕ
  suc   : ℕ → ℕ
\end{code}

Dually, conatural numbers are the terminal object in the category of algebras
over the $\mathbb{1} + {-}$ endofunctor.

In Agda, it can be represented as a coinductive record type:

\begin{code}
record ℕ∞ : Type where
  coinductive
  field
    pred : Maybe ℕ∞
\end{code}

failure of termination

Agda uses guarded corecursion to check whether a defintion is productive or not.

e.g.

However, if we want to reuse the addition operation to define multiplication, we get a non-guarded definition, which Agda rejects.
